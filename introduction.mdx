    POST https://osmosis.gulp.dev/store_knowledge
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="/delete_by_intent">
    Delete stale or irrelevant knowledge using intent matching. Keeps your knowledge base clean and relevant.
    ```bash
    POST https://osmosis.gulp.dev/delete_by_intent
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
