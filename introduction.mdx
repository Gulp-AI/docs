# Welcome to Osmosis API

Osmosis Agent Improvement API helps you build smarter, more context-aware AI agents. Our API provides essential building blocks for creating agents that learn from past interactions and make better decisions over time.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Contextual Enhancement** - Enrich your agent's responses with relevant past knowledge
- 📝 **Knowledge Storage** - Store and learn from interaction histories
- 🔄 **Continuous Learning** - Improve agent responses based on past successes
- 🧹 **Smart Cleanup** - Remove outdated or irrelevant knowledge automatically

## Core Endpoints

The API provides three main endpoints:

1. **`/enhance_task`** – Enhance an agent's query with relevant knowledge
2. **`/store_knowledge`** – Store a conversation or event history
3. **`/delete_by_intent`** – Delete stale or irrelevant knowledge

## Why Use Osmosis?

Traditional AI agents can lose context or make unpredictable choices if they're not continually learning. Osmosis helps by:

- **Storing** your interaction history for richer recall
- **Enhancing** your agent's responses with relevant past knowledge
- **Cleaning** old or irrelevant knowledge, so the agent stays accurate over time

You control how much your agent relies on AI, ensuring it remains self-healing and repeatable without becoming unpredictable.
