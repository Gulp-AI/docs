# Mintlify Documentation

## Getting Started

To install the Mintlify CLI and get a preview, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal
2. Run the following command to install the Mintlify CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm i -g mintlify
   ```
3. Once installed, navigate to your documentation directory
4. Run the following command to start the preview:
   ```bash

This will start a local development server, allowing you to preview your documentation as you work on it. The preview will automatically update as you make changes to your content.
