# Complex Event Processing

This guide demonstrates advanced event processing patterns using Gulp.

## Fraud Detection Example

```yaml
name: "Fraud Detection"
version: "1.0.0"

source:
  type: "msk"
  config:
    bootstrapServers: "${MSK_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS}"
    topics: ["transactions"]
    groupId: "fraud-detector"
    securityProtocol: "SASL_SSL"
    saslMechanism: "AWS_MSK_IAM"
    
transformations:
  - name: "Parse Transaction"
    type: "deserialize"
    format: "json"
    
  - name: "Enrich with User Data"
    type: "lookup"
    config:
      source: "dynamodb"
      table: "user_profiles"
      key: "user_id"
      fields: ["risk_score", "usual_locations"]
      
  - name: "Transaction Window"
    type: "window"
    config:
      type: "sliding"
      size: "1h"
      slide: "1m"
      key: "user_id"
      timestamp: "transaction_time"
      
  - name: "Fraud Detection Rules"
    type: "cep"
    patterns:
      - name: "High Frequency Trading"
        within: "5m"
        match:
          - condition: "count(*) > 10"
            
      - name: "Unusual Location"
        match:
          - condition: "location NOT IN usual_locations"
            
      - name: "Large Amount"
        match:
          - condition: "amount > 10000 AND risk_score > 0.7"
            
  - name: "Aggregate Alerts"
    type: "aggregate"
    groupBy: ["user_id", "pattern_name"]
    operations:
      - name: "alert_count"
        type: "count"
      - name: "total_amount"
        type: "sum"
        field: "amount"
        
sink:
  type: "kinesis"
  config:
    stream: "fraud-alerts"
    region: "us-west-2"
    partitionKey: "user_id"
    monitoring:
      enabled: true
      metrics: ["latency", "throughput", "errors"]
```

## Configuration Explanation

### Source Configuration
- Reads from MSK with IAM authentication
- Processes real-time transactions
- Secure communication with SASL/SSL

### Transformations
1. **Parse Transaction**: JSON deserialization
2. **User Enrichment**: DynamoDB lookup
3. **Window**: Sliding window for temporal analysis
4. **Fraud Detection**: Complex event patterns
5. **Aggregation**: Alert summarization

### Sink Configuration
- Real-time alerts to Kinesis
- Monitoring enabled
- Partitioned by user_id

## Pattern Details

### High Frequency Trading
Detects rapid succession of transactions:
```yaml
pattern:
  within: "5m"
  match:
    - condition: "count(*) > 10"
```

### Unusual Location
Compares transaction location with user profile:
```yaml
pattern:
  match:
    - condition: "location NOT IN usual_locations"
```

### Large Amount
Combines transaction size with risk score:
```yaml
pattern:
  match:
    - condition: "amount > 10000 AND risk_score > 0.7"
```

## Running the Example

1. Set up prerequisites:
   ```bash
   gulp resources create --file fraud-detection-resources.yaml
   ```

2. Deploy the job:
   ```bash
   gulp deploy fraud-detection.yaml
   ```

3. Monitor alerts:
   ```bash
   gulp jobs logs fraud-detection
   gulp metrics fraud-detection --pattern="alerts"
   ```
