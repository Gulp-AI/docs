# State Management

Gulp provides automated state management and infrastructure provisioning through the Gulp Web Tool, which handles all the underlying complexity of setting up and maintaining state backends.

## Automated Infrastructure Provisioning

Gulp Web Tool automatically provisions and manages the required infrastructure based on your cloud provider:

### AWS Infrastructure

```yaml
infrastructure:
  provider: "aws"
  region: "us-west-2"
  stateBackend:
    type: "s3"  # Automatically provisioned via CloudFormation
    checkpointInterval: "5m"
    
  resources:
    # Automatically provisioned and configured
    - s3StateBackend
    - dynamoDbCheckpoints
    - cloudwatchMetrics
    - iamRoles
```

The Gulp Web Tool will automatically:
- Create S3 buckets for state storage
- Set up DynamoDB tables for checkpoint coordination
- Configure IAM roles and permissions
- Set up CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- Manage infrastructure lifecycle

### GCP Infrastructure

```yaml
infrastructure:
  provider: "gcp"
  region: "us-central1"
  stateBackend:
    type: "gcs"  # Automatically provisioned via Deployment Manager
    checkpointInterval: "5m"
    
  resources:
    # Automatically provisioned and configured
    - gcsStateBackend
    - datastore
    - monitoring
    - serviceAccounts
```

The Gulp Web Tool will automatically:
- Create GCS buckets for state storage
- Set up Datastore for checkpoint coordination
- Configure service accounts and IAM
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Manage infrastructure lifecycle

## State Backend Configuration

While infrastructure is provisioned automatically, you can still configure state behavior:

```yaml
stateConfig:
  # Checkpointing Configuration
  checkpointing:
    mode: "exactly_once"  # exactly_once, at_least_once
    interval: "5m"
    timeout: "10m"
    minPause: "1s"
    maxConcurrent: 1
    
  # State Backend Options
  backend:
    incremental: true
    localRecovery: true
    memory:
      managedMemorySize: "256mb"
      retainedInMemory: "128mb"
    
  # Recovery Configuration
  recovery:
    mode: "latest-complete"  # latest-complete, latest-available
    restartStrategy: "fixed-delay"
    maxAttempts: 3
```

## Managed Features

### 1. Automatic Scaling
The Gulp Web Tool automatically scales state backend resources:

- Storage capacity adjusts based on state size
- Throughput scales with checkpoint frequency
- Memory allocation optimizes based on usage patterns

### 2. High Availability
Built-in high availability features:

- Automatic replication across availability zones
- Failover handling for state backends
- Consistent state recovery after failures

### 3. Monitoring and Alerts
Integrated monitoring system:

```yaml
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - checkpointDuration
    - checkpointSize
    - stateSize
    - recoveryTime
    
  alerts:
    - name: "LargeStateSize"
      threshold: "10GB"
      duration: "15m"
    - name: "SlowCheckpoint"
      threshold: "5m"
      duration: "10m"
```

### 4. Cost Optimization
Automatic cost optimization features:

- State cleanup for expired windows
- Storage class transitions
- Resource scaling based on usage

## Security

The Gulp Web Tool automatically configures security best practices:

```yaml
security:
  encryption:
    atRest: true
    inTransit: true
    keyRotation: "30d"
    
  access:
    networkPolicy: "private"
    authentication: "iam"
    audit: true
```

Features include:
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Network isolation
- IAM integration
- Audit logging

## Disaster Recovery

Built-in disaster recovery capabilities:

```yaml
disasterRecovery:
  backups:
    enabled: true
    frequency: "1h"
    retention: "7d"
    
  recovery:
    rpo: "1h"  # Recovery Point Objective
    rto: "15m"  # Recovery Time Objective
```

Features:
- Automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Cross-region replication
- Recovery testing

## Best Practices

1. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor state size growth
   - Track checkpoint performance
   - Set up alerts for anomalies

2. **Performance**
   - Use incremental checkpointing
   - Configure appropriate intervals
   - Enable local recovery

3. **Cost Management**
   - Enable state TTL where applicable
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Use appropriate storage classes

4. **Security**
   - Review access patterns
   - Monitor audit logs
   - Regularly rotate keys

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Storage Limits**
   - Maximum state size per key group
   - Checkpoint size limitations
   - Recovery time considerations

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Checkpoint overhead
   - Recovery time vs. state size
   - Network bandwidth requirements

3. **Cost Factors**
   - Storage costs
   - Data transfer costs
   - Operation costs

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Checkpoint Failures**
   ```yaml
   recovery:
     checkpointFailures:
       action: "retry"
       maxAttempts: 3
       backoffPeriod: "30s"
   ```

2. **State Size Issues**
   ```yaml
   stateConfig:
     cleanup:
       enabled: true
       ttl: "7d"
       cleanupInterval: "1h"
   ```

3. **Recovery Problems**
   ```yaml
   recovery:
     troubleshooting:
       diagnostics: true
       verboseLogging: true
       savepoint: "latest"
   ```
