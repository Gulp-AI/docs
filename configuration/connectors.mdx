# Sources and Sinks

Gulp supports a variety of cloud-native sources and sinks, with built-in optimizations and best practices for each service.

## Overview

Sources and sinks in Gulp are configured using a consistent YAML structure:

```yaml
source:
  type: "service-type"
  config:
    # Service-specific configuration
    
sink:
  type: "service-type"
  config:
    # Service-specific configuration
```

## Supported Services

### AWS Services

- **Sources**
  - Amazon Kinesis
  - Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka)
  - Amazon S3
  - Amazon DynamoDB Streams
  - Amazon Redshift

- **Sinks**
  - Amazon Kinesis
  - Amazon MSK
  - Amazon S3
  - Amazon Redshift
  - Amazon OpenSearch

### GCP Services
For detailed GCP service configurations, see [GCP Integration](/cloud-connectors/gcp):

  - Google Cloud Pub/Sub
  - BigQuery
  - Cloud Spanner

- **Sinks**
  - Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
  - Google Cloud Pub/Sub
  - BigQuery
  - Cloud Spanner

## Common Configuration Patterns

### Schema Configuration
All sources require a schema definition:

```yaml
source:
  type: "service-type"
  schema:
    type: "object"
    properties:
      timestamp:
        type: "long"
        format: "unix-timestamp"
      data:
        type: "object"
```

### Watermark Configuration
For event-time processing:

```yaml
source:
  type: "service-type"
  watermark:
    timestampField: "event_time"
    maxOutOfOrderness: "5s"
```

### Monitoring Configuration
Enable monitoring for sources and sinks:

```yaml
source:
  type: "service-type"
  monitoring:
    enabled: true
    metrics: ["latency", "throughput", "errors"]
```

### Fault Tolerance
Configure delivery guarantees and error handling:

```yaml
sink:
  type: "service-type"
  config:
    delivery: "exactly_once"
    retries: 3
    backoff:
      type: "exponential"
      initial: "100ms"
      maximum: "10s"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Schema Validation**: Always define schemas for your sources to ensure data quality
2. **Monitoring**: Enable monitoring for production deployments
3. **Watermarks**: Configure appropriate watermarks for event-time processing
4. **Batching**: Optimize batch sizes for your specific use case
5. **Error Handling**: Configure appropriate retry policies and error thresholds
